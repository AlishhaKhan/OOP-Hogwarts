üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è OOP Hogwarts ‚Äì A Developer's Playground for Mastering OOP in Python
OOP Hogwarts is a hands-on Python application built using Streamlit, designed to demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles through an interactive school management simulation.

This project emphasizes clean architecture, modular design, and real-time user interaction. It offers a creative yet practical approach to learning and showcasing key OOP paradigms including Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

Ideal for developers, students, and educators looking to understand how OOP concepts translate into real-world, maintainable Python code.
